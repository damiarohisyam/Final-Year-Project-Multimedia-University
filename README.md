## Project Files

### 1. Source Code Notebook  
**Filename**: `1211304435_2689_Final Year Project.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This Jupyter Notebook contains the full framework to predict football match results in the English Premier League (EPL) using machine learning. It covers data preprocessing, feature selection, and feature engineering for 30 seasons (1993/1994 to 2022/2023). The notebook uses **Support Vector Machine**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest** models. After training, the models are tested to see how well they perform.

### 2. Project Dataset  
**Folder**: `Dataset/`  
**Description**:  
The `Dataset` folder contains all the data used to train and test the models. 
The data will be sourced from https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php, specifically covering the English Premier League season1993/1994 to season 2022/2023.

**Important Instructions**:  
- **Do not modify the file paths in the code**. The code expects the dataset files to be in the **root folder** (where the Jupyter Notebook is), and **not inside any subfolders**.
- **Place each dataset file directly in the root folder**, not inside any folder like `Dataset/`. For example, the file `EPL Season 2003_2004.csv` should be placed directly in the main folder, where the notebook is located.
  

### 3. Project Interface File  
**Filename**: `Football Match Prediction_Project Interface.zip`  
**Description**:  
This folder contains the interface for showing predictions using the **Random Forest model**, which is the best performing model.

**How to Use**:  
1. Open the folder `Football Match Prediction_Project Interface` in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  
2. Open the file `Main.py`.  
3. Run `Main.py` to start the interface, which shows football match predictions using the Random Forest model.
